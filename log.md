# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Started CS50x Havard course, watch the first lesson and begin some scratch dev.

**Thoughts:** Haven't done that much this first day, finding my way around the scratch's interface.

### Day 1: January 2, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Watched CS50x second lecture about C, finished yesterday exercise and done exercises of week 1.

**Thoughts:** In one hand this is a good reminder about how things work in C, on the other hand It is a little bit too much easy, but that's ok for a beginning and I may need it.

### Day 12: January 13, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Watch the html, css, js lecture, almost done all exercises (two).

**Thoughts:** I wonder if one day I'll be ok with front development ... May be It's the UX/UI knowledge I'm missing but I NEVER know how to style things... Also I've done a todo (again).

### Day 13: January 14, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Paused CS50x again to work on my little pong like game.

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time on it ! May be too much, but things are going great and I enjoy it so why not ?!
