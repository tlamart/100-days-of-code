### Day 0: January 1, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Started CS50x Havard course, watch the first lesson and begin some scratch dev.

**Thoughts:** Haven't done that much this first day, finding my way around the scratch's interface.

### Day 1: January 2, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Watched CS50x second lecture about C, finished yesterday exercise and done exercises of week 1.

**Thoughts:** In one hand this is a good reminder about how things work in C, on the other hand It is a little bit too much easy, but that's ok for a beginning and I may need it.

### Day 4: January 5, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Still working on week's 4 exercices.

### Day 5: January 6, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Almost finished all c exercices ! I just have one error left to fix in the last one.
