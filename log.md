**Today's Progress**: Started CS50x Havard course, watch the first lesson and begin some scratch dev.

**Thoughts:** Haven't done that much this first day, finding my way around the scratch's interface.

**Today's Progress**: Watched CS50x second lecture about C, finished yesterday exercise and done exercises of week 1.

**Thoughts:** In one hand this is a good reminder about how things work in C, on the other hand It is a little bit too much easy, but that's ok for a beginning and I may need it.
